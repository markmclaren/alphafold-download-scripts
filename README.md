Inspired by [setup_databases.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sokrypton/ColabFold/main/setup_databases.sh).

Sometimes, large downloads can get interrupted, especially if you're not used to HPC systems or if you need more storage space. I made these scripts to help download the Alphafold databases. They can pick up right where the download left off if it gets interrupted.
